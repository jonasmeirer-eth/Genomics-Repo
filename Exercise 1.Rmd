```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Part b

First, sample 100 values from the Log-Normal distribution:
```{r cars}
lognorm <- rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25)
```
This is what it looks like in a **histogram**:
```{r plot}
hist(lognorm)
```

And now with a **log-scale**: 
```{r test}
hist(log(lognorm))
```

# Characterstics:
The mean is `r mean(lognorm)` and the variance is `r var(lognorm)`
